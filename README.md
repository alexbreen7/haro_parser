### Configure Your Gmail Credentials

This script is currently built to run on Gmail. It could easily be adapted to another service provider, but it's gmail for now. To configure the script to be able to read your emails:

 1. Follow these steps to create an [OAuth client ID](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id)
 2. Save the JSON secret to the same directory as the script
 3. The first time you run the script, it will ask you to sign in to your account via the browser. This will generate the token that can be used for subsequent attempts.

If you are using Google Workspace, these tokens can usually last Indefinitely. If you are using gmail, you will have to refresh them weekly. 

### Sign up for Twilio and Configure Credentials

 1. Sign up for [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
 2. Find your Twilio Auth token and SID ([Guide](https://www.twilio.com/blog/better-twilio-authentication-csharp-twilio-api-keys))
 3. Save those as environment variables: twilio_sid, twilio_token

### Configure the script with your variables.

 - **from_:** The phone number you'd like the messages to come from. Must be a number in your Twilio account.
